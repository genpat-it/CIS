# COHESIVE Information System

## A data platform to facilitate risk‚Äêanalysis and outbreak control

The OHEJP COHESIVE project aims at improving efficiency on surveillance, risk assessment and outbreak management through a One-Health approach at Member State level. The achievement of such an objective would require that each Member State the integration of pathogen data from the human, veterinary and food sectors in each Member State.

Below is a series of links to project documents shared through general-purpose open repository Zenodo.

### Implemented database

The CIS (Cohesive Information System) is basically a database with WEB interface based on the opensource CMDBUILD Project. CMDBuild is an open source web enterprise environment used to configure custom applications and to manage databases of items.

Data from different sources (Metadata from Member State, WGS Analysis and  every type of input relevant for a Member State) are collected into a Database (COHESIVE Cache) where they are subjected to a process of transformation and sanitation (cleaning) in order to make them homogeneous. Subsequently these data are subjected to a process of validation and only at this point they are ready to be transferred to the PostgresSQL database of the CIS.

### COHESIVE Information System (CIS) Virtual Machine Technical Specifications

We have installed the CIS system in a virtual machine so that each member state can import it into their own systems and use the application. The virtual machine contains all the components system needed to the CIS system, such as the web application and the database.

In the following document, an explaination on how to import the virtual machine shared in Zenodo website into the VirtualBox and launch the application to use the CIS system.
